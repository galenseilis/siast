# SIAST

This repository stores data from some of the student exercises I particpated in during my attendance at the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST). I may provide analyses of the data over time.

## Overview

This project was was generated using `kedro 0.19.6`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://docs.kedro.org) for more information on Kedro.

## Notes
- Data sets are quite small, so they are versioned along with the rest of the project.
